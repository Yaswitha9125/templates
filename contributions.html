          The Relative Expression Prediction Tool accepts the following input
          parameters: RBS Sequence, Coding Sequence, Temperature, Gram Stain of
          Chassis, 16S rRNA Sequence. It subsequently provides the relative
          expression level in terms of the RBS rate, represented on a
          logarithmic scale.
          <br /><br />
          On the other hand, the RBS Optimization Tool also receives the
          following inputs: RBS Sequence, Coding Sequence, Target Relative
          Expression, Temperature, Gram Stain of Chassis, and 16S rRNA Sequence.
          This tool then furnishes the optimized RBS sequence along with its
          corresponding predicted (logarithmically scaled) relative expression
          level.
          <br /><br />
          We rigorously evaluated our tool by subjecting it to a comprehensive
          benchmarking exercise against cutting-edge rate prediction tools,
          including the acclaimed RBS Calculator v2.1 by Salis et al., RBS
          Designer, UTR Designer, EMOPEC, and others. This evaluation was
          conducted on a meticulously curated dataset comprising 16,779 mRNA
          sequences with quantified expression levels, as assembled by Reis and
          Salis.
          <br /><br />
          The outcomes of our evaluation unequivocally establish that our tool
          has decisively surpassed the accuracy of the foremost calculators
          worldwide, doing so by a substantial margin.
          <br /><br />

        <p>
          Our model has the best performance among those compared, despite the
          inherent noise present in a FlowSeq experiment.

          <b>BioBrick parts</b><br /><br />
          We have created the following BioBrick parts generated by our RBS
          Optimization tool which have been characterized by conducting
          fluorescence assays in the wet lab.

          <br />
          We developed a novel kinetic model for engineered Lactococcus lactis
          to be used as a probiotic for the treatment of homocystinuria. Apart
          from the addition of the genes required to metabolize methionine to
          cysteine, the model incorporated the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system as a
          kill-switch.

          Kushi Athreya, a third-year BSc. Biotechnology student of Shiv Nadar
          Institute of Imminence has collaborated with IITM iGEM 2023 to
          continue the ChassiDex project. The ChassiDex project was started by
          Team iGEM IIT-Madras as an online database of host organisms and
          related information. The resource also includes host specific software
          tools and lists guidelines to help start with new host organisms.
          <br />
          <br />
          Kushi played a pivotal role in compiling data related to various Model
          and GRAS organisms, including animal models (<i
            >Zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans</i
          >
          ), plant models (<i>Tobacco, Arabidopsis</i>), and other model
          organisms (<i
            >Agrobacterium, Bacillus licheniformis, Trichoderma spp</i
          >) that we wished to include in the ChassiDex website. This was
          followed by uploading the collated data onto a publically accessible
          GitHub platform as a part of the ChassiDex project.<br />
          <br />
          The database can be accessed through the following link:<br /><br />
          <a href="https://chassidex.github.io/"

          </a>
          <br /><br />
          She has been very determined and optimistic, fostering collaboration
          throughout our exchange. This experience has been very positive and
          enriching at both ends. We look forward to future collaborations.
